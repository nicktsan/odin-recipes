        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups chicken broth, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 shallots, diced</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>sea salt to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat.</li>
            <li>Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet, and stir in the shallots. Cook 1 minute. Add rice, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in wine, stirring constantly until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
