        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Kombu Dashi and Tare</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups uncooked jasmine rice</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 onion, cut in half and sliced</li>
            <li>2 cups dashi stock, made with dashi powder</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice in 3 to 4 changes of water until the rinse water is almost clear, and drain off the rinse water. Bring the rice and 4 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a nonstick skillet with a lid, and cook and stir over medium heat until the chicken is no longer pink inside and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the onion, and cook and stir until the onion is soft, about 5 more minutes. Pour in the stock, and whisk in soy sauce, mirin, and brown sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil, and let simmer until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs in a bowl until well-beaten, and pour over the chicken and stock. Cover the skillet, reduce heat, and allow to steam for about 5 minutes, until the egg is cooked. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>To serve, place 1 cup of cooked rice per bowl into 4 deep soup bowls, top each bowl with 1/4 of the chicken and egg mixture, and spoon about 1/2 cup of soup into each bowl.</li>
        </ol>
